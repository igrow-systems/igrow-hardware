Typical LED junction capacitance pf 10-15pF

Typical LED photocurrent in the visible, I think example is for 555nm emission, absorping at 525nm with a bandwidth of ~50nm, is of the order 50pA.

Need to verify these with a physical semiconductor model perhaps.

How are the emission wavelength and absorption wavelength related?
